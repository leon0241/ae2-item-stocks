# ae2-item-stocks

Designed for Project Ozone 3 Kappa but should work with other packs too if needed  

You will need stock.lua, variables.lua, test.lua  
 
Just put it in a folder and run it. Variables.lua if you want to fiddle about with the settings or edit the stocklist. Make sure your computer is hooked up to some kind of AE2 machine.
